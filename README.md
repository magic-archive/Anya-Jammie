Project Name: Beach Run

Brief Summary of Project:  
- Our project - Beach Run, is a speed run video game. 
- We made it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- The objective of the game is to get the sprite/character to win the game and escape the beach by jumping over the obstacles, which are crabs and collecting coins.
When you collect a coin, you gain a point, but if you get bitten by a crab, you lose a point. You know you lose when you have zero lives left. When you win, crabs and coins stop coming towards you and you have at least one life left.
